  /* Preserves aspect ratio (16:9). Fits the whole sketch inside. Adds horizontal or vertical
     black bars (letterboxing) if the container's aspect ratio isn't 16:9. RECOMMENDED. */

  /* --- ALTERNATIVE (Usually not desired for games) --- */
  /* Stretches the 1280x720 content to fill the container exactly.
     Distorts the image if the aspect ratios don't match. */
